## About
School Tasker is a homework planner bot made on the Russian Telegram platform. The features of the bot are as follows:
* Recognizing users as regular and administrators in order to correctly assign appropriate powers to everyone;
* Automatic filtering of tasks by time to make reading tasks easier;
* Automatic check of tasks for “suitability” - when the deadline expires, the task is automatically deleted by algorithms in real time;
* Advanced and convenient task editor for users,
* Automatic mailing from the bot after adding a task
* and a lot of more!
<p>The development of School Tasker focuses on three principles: convenience, accessibility and speed - these are the characteristics that describe the work of School Tasker as a tool for mass use in the field of task schedulers for large audiences</p>

## Why School Tasker?
<p>School Tasker is convenient and accessible for mass use for all user roles: not only as an electronic diary for ordinary users, but also as an electronic diary for administrators (prefects and teachers)</p>
<p></p>In addition, thanks to mass mailing from the bot (which can be customized by each user), students will know exactly when, what and on what date the assignment is given</p>
<p>Over time, if this bot is in demand, School Tasker will be further developed and supplemented with new functionality</p>
